# This repository holds the final project for EC504

To compile, simply run ``make`` in the terminal and ``./a.out``


The file ``output.txt`` contains the actual output of the program when running for different point cloud sizes. By default the program is set for a point cloud size of 50000 points but this can be changed by modifying ``tree_size`` in ``main.cpp``. The data was compiled painstakingly by hand into ``data.csv`` The unit of the values in ``data.csv`` is seconds.
